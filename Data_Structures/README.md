## Summary 
**Data Structures:** Collection of values and have relations between them and functions. Each one have differences in what it can do and what it is best used for. 

There are different data structures as there are different kinds of containers in real life. For example, we have a briefcase for papers, but a fridge for food, but the fridge is not portable and uses a lot of energy. There are tons of Data Structures, but there are only about 5 useful ones to have always in mind.

There are two important things to understand data structures:
1. How to build them
2. How to use them

## How computers store data

We need to keep track of variables, usually stored in RAM. We also have storage (which is permanent).
